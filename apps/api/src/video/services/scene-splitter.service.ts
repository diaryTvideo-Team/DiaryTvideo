Your response MUST be a valid JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "character": {
    "profile": "detailed character description in English for image generation",
    "inferred_from": "reasoning for the character profile"
  },
  "voice": "male" or "female",
  "scenes": [
    {
      "scene": 1,
      "visual": "English description for image generation",
      "narration": "Korean narration text"
    }
  ]
}

Character profile rules:
1. Analyze the diary content to infer the writer's characteristics (gender, age, outfit based on context)
2. Examples:
   - "퇴근길" (commute home) → office worker attire, beige trench coat
   - "운동하다가" (while exercising) → sportswear, athletic outfit
   - "학교에서" (at school) → student, school uniform or casual
   - "아이와 놀았다" (played with child) → parent figure, comfortable clothes
3. If unable to infer, use a neutral profile like "young adult in casual attire"
4. The profile MUST include: gender, age range, hair style, clothing, and end with "realistic photography style, cinematic lighting"
5. This profile will be prepended to ALL image generation prompts for consistency

Scene rules:
- Create 1-6 scenes based on the diary content length and complexity
- CRITICAL: ONLY use information explicitly written in the diary. NEVER invent, imagine, or add content that is not in the original diary.
- If the diary is very short (1-2 sentences), create just 1 scene with the exact content
- Short diary (1-2 paragraphs): 1-2 scenes
- Medium diary (3-4 paragraphs): 3-4 scenes
- Long diary (5+ paragraphs): 4-6 scenes
- visual: English description for DALL-E image generation (describe the scene, NOT the character)
- narration: Convert the diary content to natural conversational Korean (반말/대화체). Example: "오늘 퇴근길에 힘들었다" → "오늘 퇴근길에 진짜 힘들었어". Keep the SAME meaning and information, just change the tone to casual speech. Do NOT add new details or emotions not in the original.
- FORBIDDEN: Adding backstory, context, emotions, or details not in the original diary
- If the diary says "오늘은 힘들었다. 끝." then narration should be exactly that, not an expanded version
CRITICAL - DALL-E CONTENT SAFETY (MUST FOLLOW):
- DO NOT describe people in bed, lying down, or sleeping poses
- DO NOT mention any physical contact between people (hugging, holding hands, etc.)
- DO NOT describe romantic or intimate moments
- DO NOT use words like: bed, pillow, blanket, lying, sleeping, tired, exhausted, rest
- DO NOT describe people in private spaces (bedroom, bathroom)
- ALWAYS describe people in public or neutral spaces (cafe, park, street, office, kitchen)
- ALWAYS describe people standing, sitting at desk/table, or walking
- ALWAYS use safe, mundane activities: reading, working, eating, walking, talking
- Focus on OBJECTS and ENVIRONMENT rather than the person's physical state
- When in doubt, describe a simple outdoor scene or cafe setting

Voice selection:
- Infer gender from diary content
- If unclear, default to "female"`;

    const userPrompt = `Diary Title: ${title}
Diary Content: ${content}

Analyze this diary and create:
1. A character profile based on the diary's context
2. Split into scenes based on the diary length
   - Use ONLY the exact content from the diary
   - DO NOT add any information not explicitly written
   - If the diary is short, create fewer scenes (even just 1 scene is fine)
   - Narration must be the original Korean text, not a rewritten version`;
